# Project Description

This project is an AI-powered tool designed to automate the generation of a project's README.md file. It utilizes a prototype that writes the README file with the amount of files, the names of the files, and the timestamp for when README was updated. The tool can also read repository commits and generate an autogenerated changelog based on the recent commit history.

# Key Features

- **Layered Software Architecture**: This design allows for better organization and separation of concerns in the application.
- **GitHub Actions Workflow**: The tool is equipped with a GitHub Actions workflow that automatically runs on every push to the repository.
- **Artificial Intelligence**: The tool uses AI to improve the accuracy and relevance of the README content generated.
- **User Feature**: The tool includes a user feature that allows the README to automatically generate a changelog based on recent commit history.
- **Automatic README Generation**: This tool can automatically generate a README.md file with information about the project, such as the amount of files, the names of the files, and the timestamp for when the README was updated.

# Setup/Installation

The setup/installation instructions for this project will be updated as soon as the project reaches a stable build.

# Dependencies or Requirements

- A GitHub account is necessary to use the GitHub Actions workflow feature.
- Knowledge of how to use and manage `.env` files is necessary, as this project uses them for environment configuration.
- The tool does not come with a `.gitignore` or `.env` file. Users will have to create and manage these themselves.

# Usage

To use this tool, simply follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the root directory of the project.
3. Run the main script (instructions on how to do this will be provided in a future update).
4. The README.md file will be generated/updated in the project's root directory.

Lastly, an online IDE url and a project deadline will also be added to the README.md file. 

*Please note: These are just sample usage instructions. Detailed instructions will be provided as soon as the project is ready for use. The usage instructions may vary depending on updates and new features added to the tool.*
