## Setup Instructions

To get started with Project-15, you need to set the `OPENAI_API_KEY`. This is a mandatory step and the project won't work if it is not set.

## Features

- **Auto-generate Changelog**: Project-15 has the functionality to read repository commits and auto-generate a changelog. This is a user feature that has been recently added and updated.

- **GitHub PR Integration**: The project now writes readme with existing content to the main branch instead of using GitHub API for PRs. 

- **Logging Mechanisms**: The project has been finalized with new logging mechanisms using betterstack and the logger to assist with debugging. The Logging.md document has been updated with accurate implementation details.

- **AI Functionality**: This project employs AI to generate the README.

- **Containerization**: The application is containerized for easy deployment and scalability.

- **User Action Logic**: The user action logic has been updated to commit the readme code.

- **Snapshot Build for CD Pipeline**: A snapshot build function for the continuous deployment pipeline has been added.

- **Input Validation**: Added an input validation file to ensure correct and secure data entry.

- **Frontend**: The frontend folder, which now named 'docs', provides the interface for the user.

## Usage

The project comes with a prototype that writes the README file with the amount of files, the names of the files, and timestamp for when the README was updated. However, development is ongoing and some features are currently being tested.

## Integrated Testing

We have integrated a testing suite for `parse_commit` and `count_files`. The test workflow page has been updated and the test file has been revised. You can see the status of our tests on our GitHub Actions badge. We have also removed redundancy by removing the tests stage, which is now handled by main.yml.

## Continuous Deployment

Project-15 has enabled GitHub Pages for live demo deployment and added a snapshot build for the continuous deployment pipeline. We've also integrated a mechanism for deploying live demo onto GitHub Pages through an action.

## Contributing

We are continually working on improving Project-15 and contributions are welcome. We recently moved `action.yml` to the proper actions directory and changed the Docker safe directory. We also updated the workflow name and fixed YAML indentation for users. Recently, we've updated the version file with SNAPSHOT for testing release, and made changes to the Docker safe directory. We've also integrated PRs, containerization, and added a landing page for easy navigation and user experience. Additionally, we've made improvements to our eof parsing and fixed some issues with a version file.
