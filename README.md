# Project Title

This project is an innovative solution that helps in auto-generating your project's README file. It uses AI functionality to read your repository's commits and auto-generate a changelog based on recent commit history. Apart from this, it also provides a prototype that writes the README file with the amount of files, the names of the files, and timestamps for when the README was updated.

## Key Features

- Layered Software Architecture: Makes the project more organized and easier to manage.
- GitHub Actions Workflow: Automatically triggers a set of instructions (defined in the main.yml file) upon every push to the repository.
- AI Functionality: Reads repository commits and auto-generates a changelog.
- User Feature: Automatically generates a README file with the number of files, their names, and the timestamp of the last update.
- Online IDE: Ease of access and use from anywhere.

## Setup/Installation

The project does not require any special setup or installation instructions. Just clone the repository and you are good to go.

## Dependencies

- OpenAI: Used to provide Artificial Intelligence functionality.
- GitHub Actions: Required to set up the continuous integration/continuous delivery pipeline.

## Usage Examples

To use the auto-generating README feature, commit your changes with a descriptive message. The AI functionality will read the commit and update the README file accordingly.

To use the GitHub Actions workflow, push any changes to the repository. The actions defined in main.yml will automatically be triggered.

```bash
git commit -m "Descriptive commit message"
git push
```

## Notes

- The .gitignore and .env files have been deleted from the repository. Please make sure to set up your own according to your requirements.
- Don't forget to update the online IDE url and deadline according to your project timeline.
